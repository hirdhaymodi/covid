    <p class="sectiontag text-big">A Great Introduction of Covid 19</p>
    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. Around one in five infected individuals do not develop any symptoms. While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS can be precipitated by cytokine storms, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. Longer-term damage to organs (in particular, the lungs and heart) has been observed. There is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects—known as long COVID—for months afterwards. These effects include severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low-grade fever, muscle weakness, and breathlessness.The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person. Small droplets and aerosols containing the virus can spread from an infected person's nose and mouth as they breathe, cough, sneeze, sing, or speak. Other people are infected if the virus gets into their mouth, nose or eyes.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The global shipping market has been significantly affected by the coronavirus epidemic and slowed shipments to and from China. Container-ship operators have canceled over 40 sailings previously set to arrive at the Port of Los Angeles between mid-February and April 1, 2020, resulting in a 25 percent drop in container volumes.4 Elsewhere, pileups and backlogs continue to build. While shippers and charterers may invoke force majeure clauses, such clauses are not available to certain owners who control their own vessels.Containership operators have already cancelled a significant number of sailings from China.</p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires growers and manufacturers under its jurisdiction to notify the agency of any expected supply disruptions. According to a statement issued by the agency, at least one drug is in short supply because of problems related to the coronavirus outbreak. However the FDA refused to disclose its name, the manufacturer or where the product or its ingredients are made, citing “confidential commercial information."India’s pharmaceutical industry expects supply issues relating to the coronavirus. The Trade Promotion Council of India estimates that 85 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients imported by India are from China, and notes that two-thirds of imports of bulk drugs and drug intermediates in 2018 and 2019 were from China.</p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Construction</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The global construction industry is bracing for slowing economic growth in the near term. Singapore, Canada and the US are already expecting supply chain interruptions with materials ranging from solar panels to electrical and plumbing fixtures to concrete boards and flooring tiles. Singapore is especially vulnerable because it depends on Chinese construction contractors to meet its significant labor needs. Delays in construction schedules for development projects can result in significant cost overruns.</p>

                <p class="center">Trials testing the vaccine in pregnant and breastfeeding women have not yet been
                    completed. Whether to get the vaccine in pregnancy is your choice. The information
                    below will help you make an informed choice about whether to get the COVID-19
                    vaccine if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Those with high risk medical conditions
                    (clinically extremely vulnerable) who have a
                    greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19 can get the vaccine.                   
                <p> COVID-19 vaccines do NOT contain live coronavirus. Vaccines do NOT contain any additional ingredients that are harmful to pregnant women or their babies. Other non-live vaccine(whooping cough, influenza)are considered to be safe for pregnant women and the unborn babies.</p>

                    site of injection.</p>

                <p class="center">Based on the potential availability of vaccines the
                    Government of India has selected the priority
                    groups who will be vaccinated on priority as they
                    are at higher risk.
                    <p>The first group includes healthcare workers
                    because they are at high risk of contracting the
                    infection and protecting them helps to sustain
                    essential health services. The vaccination of
                    frontline workers will help in reducing the
                    societal and economic impact by reducing COVID19 mortalities. 
                    The next group to receive COVID
                    19 vaccine will be persons over 50 years of age
                    and persons under 50 years with comorbid
                    conditions because there is high mortality in this
                    category.</p>
